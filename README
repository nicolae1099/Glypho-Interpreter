Nitu Nicolae-Iulian 331 CA Glypho Interpreter

I implemented a Glypho interpreter, which reads the source code from an input file and displays the result at standard output. 
Glypho is a programming language that is independent of the symbols used from one instruction to another.
For each point in the execution, the language interpreter deciphers the instruction that the symbols represent.
